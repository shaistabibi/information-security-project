Project Task: Combine AES encryption with steganography techniques to hide encrypted messages within images or other media.
Step 1: User Interface (UI) Design. 

- Design a simple program with buttons and input fields.
- Allow users to input their secret messages, choose images, and set passwords for encryption.
Step 2: AES Encryption Implementation.

 - Implement the AES encryption process using the cryptography library in Python.
 - Take a user's message and convert it into a secret code using a key (password).
Step 3: Steganography Implementation.

 - Develop the steganography part using the Python PIL (Pillow) library for image manipulation.
 - Embed the encrypted message into the pixels of an image without making the image look weird.
Step 4: Decryption Process.

 - Create a way for the recipient to reverse the process. 
- Decrypt the message from the image using the key without anyone else knowing what was hidden.
